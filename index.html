            Orcas, also known as killer whales, are magnificent creatures found
            in oceans worldwide. They are incredibly versatile, inhabiting both
            coastal and open ocean environments. Orcas are known for their
            impressive hunting abilities and social behavior. They can be found
            at varying depths within the ocean, depending on their specific
            activities. While hunting for prey, such as seals or fish, they can
            be observed at depths ranging from the surface to several hundred
            meters. Orcas are truly masters of the marine realm, demonstrating
            their adaptability and intelligence throughout their range.

            The Giant Oarfish is a remarkable and enigmatic marine creature
            known for its extraordinary length, with some individuals reaching
            up to 36 feet or more. This slender, ribbon-like fish inhabits the
            deep ocean, typically found at depths ranging from 200 to 1,000
            meters. However, they can occasionally venture into shallower
            waters. The Giant Oarfish's striking appearance and mysterious
            behavior have made it the subject of fascination and curiosity among
            marine biologists and enthusiasts alike.

            The Blue Whale, the largest animal to have ever existed on Earth,
            inhabits the world's oceans. These colossal marine mammals can be
            found at depths ranging from around 100 meters to 500 meters,
            although they are known to dive much deeper during feeding. Blue
            Whales primarily feed on krill, using their immense size to engulf
            large quantities of these tiny crustaceans. Their presence in the
            ocean serves as a testament to the awe-inspiring diversity and
            grandeur of marine life.

            The Giant Squid (Architeuthis dux) is a mysterious and elusive
            creature inhabiting the depths of the world's oceans. It's known to
            dwell at extreme depths, typically between 1,000 and 2,500 meters
            (3,280 to 8,200 feet) below the surface. This deep-sea giant is
            characterized by its enormous size, with some individuals reaching
            lengths of up to 43 feet (13 meters) or more. Despite its impressive
            size, it remains a rarely seen and enigmatic denizen of the ocean's
            twilight zone, shrouded in darkness and mystery.

            coastal and open waters. These majestic creatures can be found at
            various depths, typically ranging from the surface waters down to
            depths of around 4,000 feet (1,200 meters) or more. Their
            adaptability to different depths allows them to roam across a wide
            range of oceanic ecosystems, making them one of the most iconic and
            widely distributed shark species on the planet.

            at depths of around 2,000 to 2,200 meters, though it has been
            observed at even greater depths. Its claim to fame lies in its
            astonishing capacity to devour prey up to ten times its own size,
            thanks to its highly expandable stomach that allows it to engulf and
            digest large prey in the pitch-black depths of the ocean.

            Anglerfish are fascinating deep-sea creatures that inhabit some of

            can be found at depths ranging from 200 to 2,000 meters
            (approximately 660 to 6,560 feet) below the surface. These

            specialized appendage that dangles from their heads like a fishing
            rod, attracting prey in the pitch-black abyss. They have adapted to
            the extreme pressures and minimal light conditions of the deep sea,
            making them one of the most unique and mysterious denizens of the
            ocean's depths.
